# Final Writing Portfolio: The Use of Cellphones in the Student Worker Environment
This is the final writing assignment for Informatics 162W

This consists of the writings I completed throughout the quarter.

## Executive Summary:

### Introduction
This document summarizes the results found in the paper titled The Usage of Cellphones in the Student Worker Environment. The purpose of the study is to understand the nuances and implications of students being able to use their smartphone on shift in the university level student work environment.

### Conclusion (Summary of Findings)
During breaks, student workers tended to sit together in a circle but not talk to one another. In a conversation between two students, we saw that the students talked about why they enjoyed working at the Student Center. They explained that they like it because of the people aspect, although when these workers were grouped up, they were on their cell phones.

Students during work would also have a tendency to use their cellphones. This usage would affect the other workers, as the time spent on cellphones could be use to help set up other equipment.

On certain shifts, students who used their cellphones also would talk to their coworkers. The more people were interacting with each other, the less likely they were to use their phones.

### Methods
This research consists of 10 hours of qualitative ethnographic observation throughout the course of 10 weeks from January to March.

The observation was done in a different room of the Student Center for 1 to 2 hours per observation. We took field notes on three night operations shifts, two game room shifts, and one meeting. We leveraged all of our data with the literary examples to find out why and how the use of smartphones affect the efficiency of workflows. To know this, we observed what the workers are doing on their smartphones and recorded the applications they used.


### Recommendations
We recommend investigating further and asking questions relating to the correlation between the level of freedom in the workplace and overall job satisfaction. The sample size and focus group for this observation is also limited because of the 10 hours of observation. Other universities will need to be considered, as well as different types of work organizations in order to generalize these findings. Besides ethnographic observation, more qualitative studies will need to be done such as interviews with student workers and their managers. Answering these questions may help understand if smartphones actually negatively affect student worker interactions and if this can be generalized to other organizations and workers.
